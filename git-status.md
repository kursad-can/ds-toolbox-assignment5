Definition: git status

"git status" command is helpful to view the current branch we are working on. It also lists the changed file in the staging, together with the working directory. We can also see the 'untracked files' with this command. Also, it shows what changes done for the next commit step. We can view the same inforamtion from Jupyter Lab by accessing to the 'Git' tab on the interface. This view will show the same information to us.
